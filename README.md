pg_clickhouse Postgres Extension
================================

[![PGXN]][⚙️] [![Docker]][🐳] [![GitHub]][🐙] [![Postgres]][🐘] [![ClickHouse]][🏠]

This library contains `pg_clickhouse`, a PostgreSQL extension that runs
analytics queries on ClickHouse right from PostgreSQL without rewriting any
SQL. It supports PostgreSQL 13 and later and ClickHouse v23 and later.

## Getting Started

The simplest way to try pg_clickhouse is the [Docker image][🐳], which
contains the standard PostgreSQL Docker image with the pg_clickhouse
extension:

```sh
docker run --name pg_clickhouse -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my_pass \
       -d ghcr.io/clickhouse/pg_clickhouse:18
docker exec -it pg_clickhouse psql -U postgres -c 'CREATE EXTENSION pg_clickhouse'
```

See the [tutorial](doc/tutorial.md) to get started importing ClickHouse tables
and pushing down queries.

## Documentation

*   [Reference](doc/pg_clickhouse.md)
*   [Tutorial](doc/tutorial.md)

## Test Case: TPC-H

This table compares [TPC-H] query performance between regular PostgreSQL
tables and pg_clickhouse connected to ClickHouse, both loaded at scaling
factor 1; ✔︎ indicates full pushdown, while a dash indicates a query
cancellation after 1m. All tests run on a MacBook Pro M4 Max with 36 GB of
memory.

<!-- cd dev/tpch && make ch && make pg && make run -->

### Compile From Source

#### General Unix

The PostgreSQL and curl development packages include `pg_config` and
`curl-config` in the path, so you should be able to just run `make` (or
`gmake`), then `make install`, then in your database
`CREATE EXTENSION pg_clickhouse`.

#### Debian / Ubuntu / APT

See [PostgreSQL Apt] for details on pulling from the PostgreSQL Apt repository.

```sh
sudo apt install \
  postgresql-server-18 \
  libcurl4-openssl-dev \
  uuid-dev \
  libssl-dev \
  make \
  cmake \
  g++
```

#### RedHat / CentOS / Yum

```sh
sudo yum install \
  postgresql-server \
  libcurl-devel \
  libuuid-devel \
  openssl-libs \
  automake \
  cmake \
  gcc
```

See [PostgreSQL Yum] for details on pulling from the PostgreSQL Yum repository.

#### Install From PGXN

With the above dependencies satisfied use the [PGXN client] (available as
[Homebrew], [Apt] and Yum packages named `pgxnclient`) to download, compile,
and install `pg_clickhouse`:


```sh
pgxn install pg_clickhouse
```

#### Compile and Install

To build and install the ClickHouse library and `pg_clickhouse`, run:

```sh
make
sudo make install
```

<!-- XXX DSO currently disabled.
By default `make` dynamically links the `clickhouse-cpp` library (except on
macOS, where a dynamic `clickhouse-cpp` library is not yet supported). To
statically compile the ClickHouse library into `pg_clickhouse`, pass
`CH_BUILD=static`:

```sh
make CH_BUILD=static
sudo make install CH_BUILD=static
```
 -->

If your host has several PostgreSQL installations, you might need to specify
the appropriate version of `pg_config`:

```sh
export PG_CONFIG=/usr/lib/postgresql/18/bin/pg_config
make
sudo make install
```

If `curl-config` is not in the path on you host, you can specify the path
explicitly:

```sh
export CURL_CONFIG=/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/bin/curl-config
make
sudo make install
```

If you encounter an error such as:

``` text
"Makefile", line 8: Need an operator
```

You need to use GNU make, which may well be installed on your system as
`gmake`:

``` sh
gmake
gmake install
gmake installcheck
```

If you encounter an error such as:

``` text
make: pg_config: Command not found
```

Be sure that you have `pg_config` installed and in your path. If you used a
package management system such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, be sure that the
`-devel` package is also installed. If necessary tell the build process where
to find it:

``` sh
export PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config
make
sudo make install
```

To install the extension in a custom prefix on PostgreSQL 18 or later, pass
the `prefix` argument to `install` (but no other `make` targets):

```sh
sudo make install prefix=/usr/local/extras
```

Then ensure that the prefix is included in the following [`postgresql.conf`
parameters]:

```ini
extension_control_path = '/usr/local/extras/postgresql/share:$system'
dynamic_library_path   = '/usr/local/extras/postgresql/lib:$libdir'
```

#### Testing

To run the test suite, once the extension has been installed, run

```sh
make installcheck
```

If you encounter an error such as:

``` text
ERROR:  must be owner of database regression
```

You need to run the test suite using a super user, such as the default
"postgres" super user:

``` sh
make installcheck PGUSER=postgres
```

### Loading

Once `pg_clickhouse` is installed, you can add it to a database by connecting
as a super user and running:

``` sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_clickhouse;
```

If you want to install `pg_clickhouse` and all of its supporting objects into
a specific schema, use the `SCHEMA` clause to specify the schema, like so:

``` sql
CREATE SCHEMA env;
CREATE EXTENSION pg_clickhouse SCHEMA env;
```

## Dependencies

The `pg_clickhouse` extension requires [PostgreSQL] 13 or higher, [libcurl],
[libuuid]. Building the extension requires a C and C++ compiler, [libSSL], [GNU
make], and [CMake].

## Road Map

Our top focus is finishing pushdown coverage for analytic workloads before
adding DML features. Our road map:

*   Get the remaining 10 un-pushed-down TPC-H queries optimally planned
*   Test and fix pushdown for the ClickBench queries
*   Support transparent pushdown of all PostgreSQL aggregate functions
*   Support transparent pushdown of all PostgreSQL functions
*   Allow server-level and session-level ClickHouse settings via CREATE SERVER
    and GUCs
*   Support all ClickHouse data types
*   Support lightweight DELETEs and UPDATEs
*   Support batch insertion via COPY
*   Add a function to execute an arbitrary ClickHouse query and return its
    results as a tables
*   Add support for pushdown of UNION queries when they all query the remote
    database
