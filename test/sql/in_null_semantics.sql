-- NULL semantics of the IN family (ScalarArrayOpExpr pushdown).
--
-- ClickHouse evaluates IN under two-valued logic: a probe that finds no
-- match yields 0 even when the searched set contains a NULL, where Postgres
-- computes NULL, which changes negation semantics (NOT(NULL) -> NULL).
-- The has()/countEqual() functions also match a NULL probe against a NULL
-- element as if it were an ordinary value. Every shape below ships regardless:
-- deparse.c uses the cheap native form when it can prove neither side can be
-- NULL, and a guarded CASE otherwise that checks at runtime instead, computing
-- Postgres's exact three-valued answer (NULL, not FALSE, or worse, TRUE)
-- in every context. These tests ensure both forms deparse correctly and that
-- the rows returned match local (Postgres) semantics either way.
