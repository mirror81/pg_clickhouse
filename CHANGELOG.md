## [v0.1.1] — 2025-12-17

This release makes binary-only changes. Once installed, any existing use of
pg_clickhouse v0.1 will get its benefits on reload without needing to `ALTER
EXTENSION UPDATE`.

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Refactored the internal handling of the `pg_clickhouse.session_settings`
    GUC to parse the settings only once rather than for every query sent to
    ClickHouse

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed a crash when sending an empty `COPY FROM` via the binary driver

### ⬆️ Dependency Updates

*   Updated vendored clickhouse-cpp library

### 🏗️ Build Setup

*   Fixed the `Makefile` targets so that calling `make install` without first
    calling `make` will properly create the versioned SQL file.

### 📚 Documentation

*   Added a [versioning policy] the documentation
*   Fixed the badges and broken TPC-H links in [README.md]
*   Added PGXN installation instructions to [README.md]
