## [Unreleased]

### ⚡ Improvements

*   [#268] added a `compression` server option for the binary driver to enable
    ClickHouse native protocol compression of query results and `INSERT` data.
    Accepts `none`, `lz4`, or `zstd`, and defaults to `lz4`.
*   [#227] added a `secure` server option giving explicit control over TLS for
    both the binary and HTTP drivers, rather than inferring it from the host
    name and port. Accepts `on` (force TLS), `off` (force plaintext), or `auto`
    (the previous cloud-host/port heuristic, still the default). Thanks to
    Andrey Borodin for the PR ([#227]).
*   Added a `min_tls_version` server option to set the minimum TLS protocol
    version negotiated by both drivers. Accepts `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`,
    or `TLSv1.3`, and defaults to the TLS library's own minimum.
*   Added mapping for `regexp_match()` to pushdown to `extractGroups()`, or
    `arraySlice(extractAll(text, pattern), 1, 1)` if the regex contains no
    capturing groups.

### 🚀 Distribution

*   [#269] added support for PostgreSQL 19beta1.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed incorrect translation of regular expression flags introduced in
    [v0.2.0](#v020--2026-04-13) to more accurately match the Postgres behavior
    when executing in ClickHouse. We no longer automatically push down `-s`,
    because it is enabled by default in both Postgres and ClickHouse. But the
    Postgres flags `s` and `m` cancel each other out, so we only set `s` if
    there is no `m` and if there is an `m` we set `(?m-s)`.
*   Pushdown of the `p` regular expression fag as `-s` instead of `s` to more
    accurately match the Postgres behavior.
*   No longer push down regular expression functions if the regular expression
    argument is not a constant.
*   Fixed a memory leak in the http driver when not using streaming ([#281]).

## [v0.3.1] — 2026-05-02

This release makes binary-only changes. Once installed, any existing use of
pg_clickhouse v0.3 will get its benefits on reload without needing to
`ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`.

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Replaced the `clickhouse-cpp` binary client with [ClickHouse/clickhouse-c],
    pulled in as a git submodule and included in the release package under
    `vendor/clickhouse-c`. This change eliminates conflicts between the C++
    and Postgres memory & exception handling and streams query results by the
    ClickHouse block for reduced memory consumption. It also greatly reduces
    build time and the size of the library by over 75%. Thanks to serprex for
    the the new library and the PR ([#254]).
*   Added multidimensional array support across `SELECT` and `INSERT` to both
    the binary and http drivers. Rectangular ClickHouse `Array(Array(...))`
    values now map to PostgreSQL multidimensional arrays (jagged arrays not
    supported) and PostgreSQL multidimensional arrays inserted into ClickHouse
    `Array(Array(...))` columns preserve their nesting. Thanks to serprex for
    the PR ([#233]).
*   Added pushdown for [re2 extension] functions introduced in pg_re2 v0.3.0:
    `re2extractallgroupshorizontal`, `re2extractallgroupsvertical`,
    `re2regexpquotemeta`, and `re2splitbyregexp`. Thanks to serprex for the PR
    ([#232]).
*   Add pushdown for the Postgres regular expression flag `w` as `m` in
    ClickHouse.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed incorrect casting of ClickHouse `UInt16` values to `int16` in the
    Binary driver. They now correctly convert to `int32` (Postgres `INT4`).
    Part of the omnibus binary c driver conversion contributed by serprex
    ([#233]).

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-05-11

This release makes binary-compatible changes to the v0.2 releases. Once
installed, any existing use of pg_clickhouse v0.2 will benefit from its
improvements on reload. The only change that requires an upgrade revokes
`EXECUTE` from `clickhouse_raw_query()`. We recommend running this command
make this security-sensitive change:

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION pg_clickhouse UPDATE TO '0.3';
```

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Added pushdown for [re2 extension] functions, if available, to their
    ClickHouse equivalents (e.g., `re2match` → `match`, `re2extractall` →
    `extractAll`). Thanks to serprex for the PR ([#204]).
*   Added pushdown for [fuzzystrmatch] functions `soundex()` and
    `levenshtein()` (2-arg, mapped to `editDistanceUTF8`). Thanks to serprex
    for the PR ([#210]).
*   Added mapping for `JSON` => `jsonb` to the binary driver (requires
    ClickHouse 24.10 or later).
*   Added support for ClickHouse `JSON` mapped to Postgres `json`, supporting
    all the same operators and functions as the `jsonb` mapping.
*   Added pushdown for `to_char(timestamp[tz], fmt)` to ClickHouse
    `formatDateTime()`, with strict format-string validation.  Only pushes
    down when the format is a constant whose every keyword has an identical CH
    equivalent (`YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, `DDD`, `HH24`, `HH12`, `HH`, `MI`, `SS`,
    `Q`, `Mon`, `Dy`, `AM`/`PM`, plus lowercase variants). Thanks to serprex
    for the PR ([#244]).
*   Made builtin function pushdown opt-in: Postgres builtins now ship to
    ClickHouse only when explicitly mapped, so name or signature differences
    cannot silently alter results. Thanks to serprex for the PR ([#245]).
*   Added explicit mappings for `mod`, `pow`/`power`, `bit_count(bytea)`, and
    `reverse(text)` (→ `reverseUTF8`) to retain previously working pushdowns.
    Thanks to serprex for the PR ([#245]).

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed `EXPLAIN (VERBOSE)` failing with "could not find window clause for
    winref N" when window functions push down to ClickHouse. Thanks to serprex
    for the PR ([#223]).
*   Fixed the parsing of strings that start with `[` in the http driver so
    that it no longer assumes it's the start of an array. Thanks to Kaushik
    Iska for the PR ([#234]).
*   Fixed the parsing of strings in the http driver to distinguish a true
    `NULL` value from a string containing `\N`. Thanks to Kaushik
    Iska for the PR ([#235]).
*   Fixed the `column_name` foreign-table column option being ignored by
    `INSERT`, which caused the binary engine to fail to match ClickHouse block
    columns and the HTTP engine to deparse PostgreSQL attribute names. Thanks
    to serprex for the PR ([#231]).
*   Fixed `length(text)` and `strpos(text, text)` pushdown to map to
    `lengthUTF8` and `positionUTF8` rather than ClickHouse's byte-counting
    `length` and `position`, matching Postgres character semantics. Thanks to
    serprex for the PR ([#245]).
*   Stopped pushing down `asin`, `acos`, `atanh`, and `acosh`: Postgres raises
    an error on out-of-range input where ClickHouse returns `NaN`. Evaluating
    locally preserves Postgres semantics. Thanks to serprex for the PR
    ([#245]).

### 📚 Documentation

*   Added "Extension Pushdown" section to the [reference
    docs](doc/pg_clickhouse.md), covering re2, intarray, and fuzzystrmatch
    support.
*   Added recommendation to the [reference docs](doc/pg_clickhouse.md) to
    consider using the [re2 extension] and disabling Postgres regular
    expression pushdown.
*   Documented the `column_name` foreign table column option in the [reference
    docs](doc/pg_clickhouse.md).
*   Added `jsonb_extract_path_text()` and `jsonb_extract_path()` to the list
    of push down functions in the [reference docs](doc/pg_clickhouse.md),
    along with `json_extract_path_text()` and `json_extract_path()`, which are
    new in this release.
*   Fixed the reversed descriptions of `->>` and `->` in the list of pushed
    down operators in the [reference docs](doc/pg_clickhouse.md).

### 🚀 Distribution

*   Added the [ca-certificates package] and the [re2 extension] to the OCI
    (née Docker) images.

### 🚨 Security Fixes

*   Added SQL to revoke `EXECUTE` permission on `clickhouse_raw_query()` from
    `PUBLIC`. Leaving it executable by `PUBLIC` would allow any database user
    to reach internal services (metadata endpoints, private APIs, etc.) from
    the PostgreSQL server — a classic [SSRF] vector. This ensures that admins
    can limit access only to those who legitimately need to execute ad-hoc
    ClickHouse queries (e.g., a dedicated ClickHouse admin role). Thanks to
    Andrey Borodin for the PR ([#228]).

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-04-13

This release makes binary-compatible changes to the v0.1 releases. Once
installed, any existing use of pg_clickhouse v0.1 will benefit from its
improvements on reload. The only new feature that requires an upgrade is the
`pgch_version()` function. Run this command to add it to the extension:

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION pg_clickhouse UPDATE TO '0.2';
```

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Changed the pushdown mappings for the current date and timestamp functions
    to account for the session time zone and Postgres-standard millisecond
    precision, as follows:
    *   `CURRENT_DATE` -> `toDate(now(TZ))`
    *   `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` and `LOCALTIMESTAMP` => `now64(9, TZ)`
    *   `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(n)` and `LOCALTIMESTAMP(n)` => `now64(n, TZ)`
    *   `clock_timestamp()`, `statement_timestamp()`, &
        `transaction_timestamp()` => `nowInBlock64(n, TZ)`
*   Added pushdown for the `CURRENT_TIME` and `LOCALTIME` SQL Value Functions
    to `toTime64(now64(6, TZ), 6)`, supported by ClickHouse 25.8+.
*   Added `pgch_version()`, which returns the full semantic version.
    This is the same value visible in `pg_get_loaded_modules()`, but available
    in Postgres versions prior to 18, and without having to load
    pg_clickhouse in advance.
*   Added support for pushing down the flags passed to `regexp_like()` by
    prepending them to the regular expression (e.g., `(?i)foo`). If any of the
    flags cannot be pushed down, the regular expression function will not be
    pushed own.
*   Added pushdown for `regexp_split_to_array()` to `splitByRegexp()`,
    including pushdown of applicable flags.
*   Added pushdown mappings for array functions: `array_cat`, `array_append`,
    `array_remove`, `array_to_string`, `cardinality`, `array_length`,
    `array_prepend`, `string_to_array`, `trim_array`, `array_fill`,
    `array_reverse`, `array_shuffle`, `array_sample`, `array_sort`.
*   Added mapping for `split_part()` to pushdown `splitByString()[n]`.
*   Added pushdown for array operators: `@>` (`hasAll`), `<@` (`hasAll`),
    `&&` (`hasAny`).
*   Array slice syntax (`arr[L:U]`, `arr[:U]`, `arr[L:]`) now pushes down
    as `arraySlice()`.
*   Added mapping for `regexp_replace(4-arg)` to pushdown to
    `replaceRegexpAll()` when the `g` flag is set, and to prepend compatible
    flags to the pushed down expression, or not to push down if any are not
    compatible.
*   All regular expression functions with compatible flags and all regular
    expression operators now push down prepended with `(?-s)` unless the `s`
    flag is set, so that the behavior more closely approximates that of
    Postgres.
*   Added the `pg_clickhouse.pushdown_regex` setting to prevent regular
    expressions from being pushed down.

### ⬆️ Dependency Updates

*   Updated vendored clickhouse-cpp library to v2.6.1.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed a malformed type name in the error message when the http driver is
    unable to map a ClickHouse type to a Postgres type.
*   Fixed reversal of the arguments passed to the ClickHouse `match()`
    function by the mapping from `regexp_like()`.
*   `array_dims`, `array_ndims`, `array_lower`, `array_upper`, `array_replace`,
    `array_positions`, `array_fill (3-arg)`, `array_sort (3-arg)`, and
    `string_to_array(3-arg)` now evaluate locally instead of being pushed to
    ClickHouse where they would fail.
*   Changed pushdown for `regexp_replace(3-arg)` from `replaceRegexpAll()` to
    `replaceRegexpOne()`.

### 📔 Notes

*   Added tests to ensure that `concat_ws()` successfully pushes down to the
    compatible function of the same name (an alias for [concatWithSeparator]).

  [v0.2.0]: https://github.com/ClickHouse/pg_clickhouse/compare/v0.1.10...v0.2.0
  [concatWithSeparator]: https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/string-functions#concatWithSeparator


## [v0.1.10] — 2026-04-06

This release makes binary-only changes. Once installed, any existing use of
pg_clickhouse v0.1 will get its benefits on reload without needing to
`ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`.

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Added mapping for the `JSON` and `JSONB` `-> TEXT` and `->> TEXT`
    operators to be passed down to ClickHouse using its [sub-column syntax].
    Thanks Kaushik Iska for the PR ([#169]).
*   Added pushdown support for `jsonb_extract_path_text()` and
    `jsonb_extract_path()` to ClickHouse [sub-column syntax]. Thanks Kaushik
    Iska for the PR ([#176]).
*   Added mapping to push down `now()` to [now64] rather than [now], as
    previously, because PostgreSQL's `now()` produces sub-second precision, so
    should its clickHouse equivalent.
*   Added mappings to push down the Postgres `statement_timestamp()`,
    `transaction_timestamp()`, and `clock_timestamp()` functions to to
    [nowInBlock64][] (requires ClickHouse 25.8 or higher).
*   Pushdown window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `LEAD`,
    `LAG`, `FIRST_VALUE`, `LAST_VALUE`, `NTH_VALUE`, `NTILE`, `CUME_DIST`,
    `PERCENT_RANK`, `MIN`/`MAX OVER`) to ClickHouse instead of computing
    them locally. Thanks Kaushik Iska for the PR ([#175]).
*   Pushdown `bool_and`/`every` as `groupBitAnd`, `bool_or` as `groupBitOr`,
    and `string_agg` as `groupConcat` to ClickHouse. Thanks serprex for the PR
    ([#184]).
*   Added mapping to push down the Postgres "SQL Value Functions", including
    `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `CURRENT_USER`, and `CURRENT_DATABASE`.
*   Changed the behavior of `CURRENT_DATABASE()` to push down the name of the
    current Postgres database rather than to the ClickHouse
    `current_database()` function.
*   Added result set streaming to the HTTP driver. The new `fetch_size` server
    and table option specifies the size of each batch to stream and defaults
    to `50000000`, about 50MB. Set it to `0` to disable streaming altogether.
    A testing loading a 1GB table reduced memory consumption from over 1GB to
    73MB peak. Thanks Kaushik Iska for the testing and PR ([#181]).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   Improved memory management, fixing potential crashes in out of memory
    situations. Thanks to serprex for the PRs ([#173], [#173]).
*   Fixed issue where the `-Merge` suffix was not consistently appended to
    aggregates on `AggregateFunction` columns. Thanks to serprex for the PR
    ([#179]).
*   Fixed `NTILE`, `CUME_DIST`, and `PERCENT_RANK` pushdown failing because
    the FDW emitted a `ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING` frame clause that ClickHouse
    rejects for ranking functions. Thanks serprex for the PR ([#184]).
*   `regr_avgx`, `regr_avgy`, `regr_count`, `regr_intercept`, `regr_r2`,
    `regr_slope`, `regr_sxx`, `regr_sxy`, `regr_syy`, `json_agg_strict`, and
    `jsonb_agg_strict` now evaluate locally instead of being pushed to
    ClickHouse where they would fail. Thanks serprex for the PR ([#184]).

### 📔 Notes

*   Eliminated use of a constant that required libcurl 7.87.0, restoring
    support for earlier versions.
*   Introduced clang-tidy and integrated it into `make lint` and for use in
    CI. Thanks to serprex for the PR ([#177]).

## [v0.1.6] — 2026-04-02

This release makes binary-only changes. Once installed, any existing use of
pg_clickhouse v0.1 will get its benefits on reload without needing to
`ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`.

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Added support for the PostgreSQL `to_timestamp(float8)` function, mapped to
    `fromUnixTimestamp(toInt64())` in ClickHouse.

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Disabled query pushdown for JSONB subscript syntax (e.g.,
    `col_name['field']`) for now. Thanks Kaushik Iska for the PR (#161).
*   Added query cancellation via Ctrl-C and `statement_timeout` to the binary
    driver. Thanks Kaushik Iska for the PR (#162) that fixed this issue (#41).
*   Fixed `LIKE`, `ILIKE`, and regex operator pushdown, including `~~*`,
    `!~~*`, `~`, `!~`, `~*`, `!~*`. Thanks Kaushik Iska for the PR (#164).

  [v0.1.6]: https://github.com/ClickHouse/pg_clickhouse/compare/v0.1.5...v0.1.6

## [v0.1.5] — 2026-03-20

This release makes binary-only changes. Once installed, any existing use of
pg_clickhouse v0.1 will get its benefits on reload without needing to
`ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`.

### 🚨 Security Fixes

*   Changed the http driver connection function to raise an error if the
    database name contains line ending characters to prevent HTTP header
    injection.
*   Fixed an SQL injection vulnerability in parsing of parameters to the
    `engine 'CollapsingMergeTree($sign)` option to `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE`.

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed a crash due to an unexpected EOF while the http driver parses a
    response. Thanks to @serprex for the fix (#153)
*   Fixed a crash due to an unchecked memory allocation while the http driver
    reads a response. Thanks to @serprex for the fix (#154).

  [v0.1.5]: https://github.com/ClickHouse/pg_clickhouse/compare/v0.1.4...v0.1.5

## [v0.1.4] — 2026-02-17

This release makes binary-only changes. Once installed, any existing use of
pg_clickhouse v0.1 will get its benefits on reload without needing to `ALTER
EXTENSION UPDATE`.

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Added support for the PostgreSQL `md5()` function, mapped to
    `lower(hex(MD5()))` in ClickHouse.
*   Added support for mapping PostgreSQL BYTEA columns to ClickHouse String
    columns.
*   Added explicit setting of `format_tsv_null_representation` and
    `output_format_tsv_crlf_end_of_line` to all http requests, as unexpected
    values will interfere with its operation.
*   Improved the error message from the binary driver when attempting to
    insert a `NULL` into a column that is not `Nullable(T)`.

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed binary driver errors when attempting to insert a `NULL` value into
    `Nullable` Numeric, Text, `Enum`, `UUID`, and `INET` columns. Thanks to
    Rahul Mehta for the report (#140).
*   Fixed http driver array parsing, which previously did not properly parse
    string values and would raise an error on values containing brackets
    (`[]`). Thanks to serprex for the spot (#142).
*   Fixed a bug where the binary driver would raise an error on an empty
    array.

### 📔 Notes

*   Refactored and improved the http engine's result processing, bringing it
    into closer alignment with the binary engine and removing double
    processing of row values.
*   The http driver now ignores the following session settings from the
    `pg_clickhouse.session_settings` to prevent them from interfering with its
    operation: `date_time_output_format`, `format_tsv_null_representation`,
    and `output_format_tsv_crlf_end_of_line`.

  [v0.1.4]: https://github.com/ClickHouse/pg_clickhouse/compare/v0.1.3...v0.1.4

## [v0.1.3] — 2026-01-23

This release makes binary-only changes. Once installed, any existing use of
pg_clickhouse v0.1 will get its benefits on reload without needing to
`ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`.

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Changed the default mapping for `DateTime` and `DateTime64` values from
    `TIMESTAMP` to `TIMESTAMPTZ`, because ClickHouse stores `DateTime`s as a
    Unix timestamp, always normalized to UTC, even if it displays as a
    different time zone. As of the first bug fix listed below, pg_clickhouse
    (almost) always fetches these values in UTC, so can store them as
    `TIMESTAMPTZ` values.
*   Implemented `INSERT` support for the UUID and INET (IPv4 and IPv6) types.
    Thanks to Rahul Mehta for the report ([#127])!

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed time zone conversion in the http engine. Does not work with
    parameterized execution on ClickHouse versions prior to 25.8 due to
    [ClickHouse Issue 88088]; recommend using the binary engine for tables
    with timestamp values on earlier ClickHouse versions to avoid the issue.
*   Fixed a server crash when attempting to insert types not yet supported by
    the binary engine.

### 🚀 Distribution

*   Added the [security policy](SECURITY.md).

### 📔 Notes

*   [Scripted] the generation of the TPC-H results table and updated it in the
    [README](README.md).
*   Cleaned up some comments and old references to postgres_fdw left from the
    original fork in 2019.
*   Added tests demonstrating subqueries that pg_clickhouse does not yet push
    down, to be improved in future releases.

### 🏗️ Build Setup

*   Added pre-commit hooks to lint the code, including for indentation
    enforced by `pg_bsd_indent`. A new workflow ensures consistency for these
    quality checks. Relatedly, a number of issues found by the linters have
    been corrected.
*   Configured `make installcheck` to run the tests in parallel, resulting in
    far faster test execution on multi-core systems. Adjusted the schemas in
    which some of the tests work to ensure they don't stomp on each other.

## [v0.1.2] — 2026-01-07

This release makes binary-only changes. Once installed, any existing use of
pg_clickhouse v0.1 will get its benefits on reload without needing to
`ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`.

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Added support for parameterized execution, including `PREPARE` and
    `EXECUTE`, by converting PostgreSQL `$1`-style parameters to ClickHouse
    `{param:type}`-style parameters.
*   Added support for inserting arrays to the http engine.

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed the http engine's parsing of UUID arrays selected from ClickHouse.
*   Fixed the binary engine's conversion of Date values, which in arrays ended
    up too large by several orders of magnitude (e.g., `2025-12-05` would be
    converted to `10529827-09-17` 😱). Thanks to Tom Lane for the pointer to
    the proper function to easily convert epoch seconds to a date.
*   Fixed a binary engine bug where dates and timestamps for epoch 0
    (`1970-01-01 00:00:00`) rendered as `NULL`.
*   Added support for the `Date32` ClickHouse type.
*   Fixed conversion of `array_agg()` to support ClickHouse versions prior to
    23.8.
*   Fixed the precision of fractional seconds in the binary engine's
    conversion of ClickHouse `DateTime64` values to Postgres `TIMESTAMP`
    (#114).

### 📔 Notes

*   Removed unused code designed to support custom PostgreSQL extensions:
    [ajbool], ajtime, [country], and [istore].
*   Tweaked cost estimation to encourage pushdown of `min()` and `max()`.

### 📚 Documentation

*   Documented `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` identifier case preservation behavior.
*   Fixed the Postgres Docker start and connect info in the
    [tutorial](doc/tutorial.md).
*   Fixed the commands to start and connect to the pg_clickhouse Docker image
    in the [tutorial].
*   Added complete DML documentation to the [reference
    docs](doc/pg_clickhouse.md), including the new `PREPARE`/`EXECUTE` support
    and `INSERT`, `SET`, `COPY`, as well as shared library preloading.
*   Documented the Postgres aggregate functions known (via new tests) to push
    down to ClickHouse.

## [v0.1.1] — 2025-12-17

This release makes binary-only changes. Once installed, any existing use of
pg_clickhouse v0.1 will get its benefits on reload without needing to
`ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`.

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Refactored the internal handling of the `pg_clickhouse.session_settings`
    GUC to parse the settings only once rather than for every query sent to
    ClickHouse

### 🚨 Security Fixes

*   Updated the SQL query rewriting to properly quote strings and identifiers
    in SQL queries sent to ClickHouse, fixing potential SQL injection
    vulnerabilities, notably via `IMPORT SCHEMA`. This has the effect of
    preserving mixed-case and uppercase identifiers.

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed a crash when sending an empty `COPY FROM` via the binary driver

### ⬆️ Dependency Updates

*   Updated vendored clickhouse-cpp library

### 🏗️ Build Setup

*   Fixed the `Makefile` targets so that calling `make install` without first
    calling `make` will properly create the versioned SQL file.

### 📚 Documentation

*   Added a [versioning policy] the documentation
*   Fixed the badges and broken TPC-H links in [README.md]
*   Added PGXN installation instructions to [README.md]
